# ChrysaLisp

![](./screen_shot_1.png)

Implementation of system services allowed me to implement a multi-thread
debugger and single stepping logger. The Boing demo and Global tasks test now
exercise the features. New Debug app is in apps/debug/app.lisp, note there is
only Lisp code involved in this app. :)

------

Took a detour to create a C++ version of ChrysaLisp to directly compare with my
hand rolled compiler and format. The Lisp side of that project is now done and
can build the full OS from the same source files.

Based on comparison builds of the ChrysaLisp OS source using its own
compiler/assembler and the C++ version, ChrysaLisp native is around 2.5x faster
than the Clang C++ version.

The C++ Lisp executable on its own is currently 279kb, while the entire
ChrysaLisp OS including its compiler and Lisp and libraries, GUI etc, is 165kb.
